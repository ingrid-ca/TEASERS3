    <h1>Caffeine</h1>
    <p>Tea's caffeine content can vary from no caffeine at all to having nearly as much as coffee. The exact amount depends on the type of tea and how it is brewed. In addition, tea is desirable to many because its stimulating effect can last longer than coffee but with a reduced crash.</p>
