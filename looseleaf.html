    <h1>Loose leaf vs. bags</h1>
    <p>In the US, 65% of all tea comes in tea bags due to its convenience and the ease of use, however loose leaf tea is preferred by tea enthusiasts due to its superior quality.</p>
    <p>Tea bags are typically made using finely ground, low-quality tea while loose leaf tea uses higher quality whole tea leaves and when brewed correctly, produces a more complex flavor.</p>
    <p>Through the ritual of brewing loose leaf tea, many people develop a deeper personal connection with it.</p>
