    <h1>Herbal teas</h1>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, herbal teas are not actually teas in that they do not contain the Camellia Sinesis plant and instead are made of various infusions of herbs, spices, flowers, and dried fruits.</p>
    <p>Some popular herbal teas include rooibos, chamomile, and lavender.</p>
